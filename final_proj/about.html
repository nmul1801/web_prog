            <div class="descr">It was a typical day at our liquor store until a car crashed into our building, causing significant damage. We were forced to close for a period of time while repairs were made and it was a challenging experience for our business. The cost of repairs and renovations was significant, and it was a difficult financial burden for us to bear. We were overwhelmed by the outpouring of support we received from the community during this time, which helped us to persevere through the challenges. Though the experience was tough, we're proud of how we came together as a team and the resilience we showed as a business. Today, our store is thriving once again.</div>
