                <p>
                    If you are interested in your child following in our footsteps and becoming a deadly dish 
                    detector themselves, we urge you to enroll in our summer camp!  Are you ready to put your 
                    child's taste buds to the test? Join us for our annual summer camp where children can practice their 
                    food testing abilities and learn about the importance of food safety. Our campers will have the 
                    opportunity to learn from our experienced team of food testing professionals, who will guide 
                    them through various testing techniques and educate them on the dangers of foodborne illnesses. 
                    Through hands-on activities and interactive learning experiences, campers will develop critical 
                    thinking skills and learn how to identify potential hazards in food. So, come join us this summer 
                    for a fun and educational experience that could one day save your life! Note that this 
                    camp requires a screening process — your child will be required to note the difference between a 
                    lethal and nonlethal dinner in order to be eligible for our camp.
