                The team at the deadly dinner detectors has been eating my food for over 30 years. 
                They've successfully eaten and detected over 20 dishes that contained 
                poisonous food, while providing excellent customer service along the way.

                I've been a customer of the Deadly Dinner Detectors since I was 6 years old. 
                Every dish served in my kitchen is vetted by a member of the team. They help my
                customers feel safe eating my food. I'd like to give a huge thanks to the DDDs!

                Being a mother with another child on the way, I always make sure that all my meals
                are safe to eat by hiring a member of the Deadly Dinner Detectors. We've had some close
                calls with delayed poison, but the Deadly Dinner Detectors always find when a food that
                I'm about to eat is poisoned. I don't know where I'd be without the team.

                Wow, thanks to the Deadly Dinner Detectors, my life has been saved more than 200 times.
                I feel bad for their employees, but the work they do is so brave, I can't believe their 
                consistency. For a loyal customer like me, the cervice is unmatched. They've even
                offered to send up to three employees to triple check the same dish!

                Yes, I know that I may be biased due to my relationship with one of the lead testers,
                Jacob Greenwald. But I actually think that makes my testimony more reliable. Jacob is
                dedicated to his work. Day in and day out, he's commited to testing every one of our meals
                before I take a bite. The strain it has put on our relationship is undeniable, but I assure
                you he is extremely dedicated to his work.

                When I'm not playing fifa with donald and barry, there's nothing I love more than eating.
                Finding a way to enjoy the food that I want to enjoy has been a struggler, and the secret 
                service doesn't let me order from places like Pizza Hit without some way to make sure that
                it's safe. The Deadly Dinner Detectors have helped me enjoy what I love again. I can't thank
                them enough;
