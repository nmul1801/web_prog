                The team at the deadly dinner detectors has been eating my food for over 30 years. 
                They've successfully eaten and detected over 20 dishes that contained 
                poisonous food, while providing excellent customer service along the way.

                I've been a customer of the Deadly Dinner Detectors since I was 6 years old. 
                Every dish served in my kitchen is vetted by a member of the team. They help my
                customers feel safe eating my food. I'd like to give a huge thanks to the DDDs!

                Being a mother with another child on the way, I always make sure that all my meals
                are safe to eat by hiring a member of the Deadly Dinner Detectors. We've had some close
                calls with delayed poison, but the Deadly Dinner Detectors always find when a food that
                I'm about to eat is poisoned. I don't know where I'd be without the team.
